# SSE-Fallout-4-Automatic
Fully integrated all my Skyrim/Fallout tools into a simple CLI based program

**NOTES:**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: for animations it will dectect the hkx version(s)(32-Bit/64-Bit) and(2010/2014) and convert them based appon that info.

Note: it requires all the required tools to be in the data folder.

Note: If you get stuck on "Converting Animations" double check havok content tools is installed and copied it to the data folder.

Note: The Data Folder Set-up is identical to my other tools execpt everything is in one folder... how it should look:
